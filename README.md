It's a lot like Hubot
=======================

We took much of the general structural idea from [GitHub's Hubot](http://hubot.github.com). We built a self-contained core, an initial set of plugins, and a tiny example app to show others how to build their own dashboard suitable for deployment to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com) or [Heroku](http://heroku.com).
